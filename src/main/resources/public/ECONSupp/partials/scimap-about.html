<h1>About</h1>
<p>This supports the exploration of different metrics that aim to capture high-impact and transformative science (HITS) [1].  MEDLINE publications that score highly on a metric are overlaid on the UCSD Map of Science that organizes all scholarly activity into 554 subdisciplines that are aggregated into 13 disciplines which are color coded and labeled [2]. Hovering over a discipline name highlights all its subdisciplines; hovering over a subdiscipline highlights all other subdisciplines linked to it. Use +- in top-left or the scroll wheel on the mouse to zoom, centered on the mouse pointer.
Up to four HITS metrics can be selected and compared. A time slider supports focusing on a specific timeframe, such as a period of transformation in a field of interest. Hovering over a hexagonal node brings up the subdiscipline name as well as the metric values for the selected timeframe. It will also highlight those nodes that are linked to that node via edges and are closely related to that node via citation patterns. Clicking on a node brings up a window (in lower-left) with the discipline and subdiscipline name, a listing of key papers published in that subdiscipline, and a bar graph visualization of the metrics. Click on a paper title to read the paper in MEDLINE.  </p>
